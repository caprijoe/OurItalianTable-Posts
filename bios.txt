Our Italian Table is a collaboration between Michele and Joe Becci, sister and brother, who grew up in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. They are the children of two wonderful first-generation Italian-Americans.

Phillipsburg, a small town on the Delaware River in Northwestern Jersey, was home to a large influx of Italian immigrants in the early 20th century.

Michele and Joey's love of cooking started with helping their mother prepare Sunday's meal after church by rolling meatballs or making ravioli and gnocchi. As they have pursued successful careers in the technology sector, their love for cooking has only deepened, leading Michele to invite Joey to co-found their "Our Italian Table" blog in 2008. Sharing their "food, wine and wanderings" from their beloved Italy, where they both spend time as often as possible, has become a passion and a joy appreciated by family, friends, and many other readers.
